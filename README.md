# University-School-Pages
.NET 6.0 project made using Razor Pages.
It works with a SQL database using a connection string. We have students, courses, instructors, and enrollments. Students can enroll in different courses and the courses have different students. On the other hand, each course has an instructor, who teaches the classes.
